# android-12-beta-bug-activity-doesnt-pause

Tracker link: https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/202616720

The issue: clicking the "Recent" button on the device navigation bar doesn't pause or stop the Activity as it does in Android 11. I have checked this change https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#activity-lifecycle and it doesn't say anything about this behavior.
